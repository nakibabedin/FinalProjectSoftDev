Twitter Clone: Our goal was to create an application that mimics much of the functionality of twitter. In our project, users can create tweets, view tweets in a reverse chronological timeline and from other accounts, and chat with fellow users in a global chat.

#### Features

1. Registration and Login: Users can create a new account by registering with a unique username and password. Existing users can log in to their accounts to access their personalized timelines.

2. Tweeting: Once logged in, users can compose and post tweets, limited to a certain character count (e.g., 280 characters). Share your thoughts, ideas, or interesting findings with the world!

3. Timeline: Users can view a reverse chronological feed of tweets from the people they follow. Stay updated with the latest posts from your friends and favorite accounts.

4. Chat: Users can engage in a conversation with one or more of their peers in a groupchat
